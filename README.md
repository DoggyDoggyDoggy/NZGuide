# NZGuide

NZGuide is a simple yet powerful Android app that helps users explore cities in New Zealand. It’s built using Jetpack Compose with Clean Architecture and MVVM, and offers 5‑day weather forecasts, live event listings, rich city histories, and top‑attraction guides.

**🛠️ Note:** NZGuide is currently being developed in a private repository. I plan to make it public soon as the app takes shape.
