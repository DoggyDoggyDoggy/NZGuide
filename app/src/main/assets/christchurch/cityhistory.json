    "Christchurch, known as Ōtautahi in Māori, is the largest city in the South Island. The area was originally settled by the Waitaha people, and later became home to the Ngāi Tahu iwi. Its location on the fertile Canterbury Plains made it ideal for Māori agriculture and settlement.",
    "In 1850, European settlers from the Canterbury Association established Christchurch as a planned Anglican settlement. It became New Zealand’s first official city by Royal Charter in 1856 and developed rapidly thanks to sheep farming and trade.",
    "Today, Christchurch is known for its English heritage, beautiful gardens, and as a symbol of resilience following the devastating earthquakes of 2010–2011. The city has since undergone major urban renewal and innovation."
